# Filters

* [ ] By Topic, tag or rating.
* [ ] Sort by different attributes (rating, date published, claps, or match).
* [ ] Implement reading time interval filters. 


## Exogenous Requirements

* The algorithm for match may need to be updated. Possibly to comprise the full 100 stories and stretch it to 60%.


## Implementation

1. [X] Design Dropdown Atom.
2. [X] Develop Search Filters Molecule. 
3. [X] Add Listeners and Events to the Grid.
4. [X] Handle Grid with 100 Stories.
5. [X] Document tests.

## Tests 

* [X] Styling is good, filters are hidden in mobile.
* [X] The first four filters work, results are checked using React Dev Tools.
* [X] The unfiltered version is also congruent, at initial useEffect.
* [ ] Sorting works, and understand if the original stories component is modified as a result.
* [X] The hide filters click listener works when clicking on the Grid.
